# PortfolioProjects


This project is a SQL project that I was using to sharpen my skills with SQL commands as well as beginning to interpret the data I was given for the COVID-19 pandemic.
I was able to interpret this data by using Tableau which was my first time doing, which really brought light as to what I can do as a data analyst to show impact.
